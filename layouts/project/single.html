          Dashboard data can be extracted from heterogeneous sources of information such as Prometheus, JDBC databases, or regular text files.
          
          The resulting dashboard can be deployed in a cloud environment using DashBuilder Runtime.
          
          In this guide, we will show you how to create your first dashboard using DashBuilder in designer and Java mode.

          Custom Task Support Enhancement on BPMN
          We made many improvements regarding custom task support on BPMN, especially related to compatibility with Business Central projects.</p></div>
        <div><h3>SIMPLEST CUSTOM TASKS IN KOGITO</h3><p>As a Kogito developer, you can add custom tasks to the designer palette. Customs tasks are processâ€™ activities that allow users to perform custom operations within your process flows. In addition, custom tasks can predefine different visual and execution time properties of the node on the canvas. An example can be input and output parameters, icon, predefined name, documentation, and others.

          In this example, we will take a look at how to create basic custom tasks from scratch. We will use Kogito developers tools for VS Code.</p></div>
